body{
	background-color: blue;
	background: url("1.png") no-repeat;
}

This results in removing blue background and just the image alone because having a background selector without a dash
can cause all of the background contents to renew, this removes the blue background to nothing (default) as well. 
If you want to add the blue background again, just add it to the side of no-repeat;
