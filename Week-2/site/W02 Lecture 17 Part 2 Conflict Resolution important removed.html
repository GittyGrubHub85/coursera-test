  <p class="blurb">Text color turns blue since the style's selector used is <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 150%;">header.navigation p</span> as it has a specificity score of 12. While <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 150%;">p</span> selector only has 10, it doesn't win out the selector score of 12.</p>
